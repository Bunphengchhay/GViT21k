### Note
This is the project assignment for my deep learning class at San Jose State Assignment, Fall 2023.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to leverage the advanced capabilities of pre-trained models in facial expression recognition. By utilizing models from Hugging Face, a leading repository for state-of-the-art machine learning models, and Vision Transformer (ViT), this project aims to develop a robust system capable of accurately identifying and classifying a range of human facial expressions.

The focus is on fine-tuning these pre-existing, powerful models to adapt to the specific nuances of facial expression data. This approach is expected to enhance the model's performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and reliability in real-world applications.
